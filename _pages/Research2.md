## Working Papers


* **Police scandals and deterrence: an exploration from traffic offenses and accidents** *([pdf](/assets/Scandals.pdf))*
	
	**Abstract**:
	Increasing the deterrent effect of sanctions is a pressing public policy issue in many areas where state's capacity to punish all wrongdoers is limited. Criminologist have argued for increasing the legitimacy of institutions in charge of enforcing the law, i.e. the police, in order to have more deterrent sanctions. This paper uses traffic tickets and road accidents in Bogotá, Colombia to study whether sanctions imposed by more legitimate authorities are more deterrent. My estimation compares the behavior of drivers that get their first tickets on days just after a police scandal with drivers that get their first tickets just before a scandal, or on any non-scandal day. Drivers that get their tickets just after a police scandal are 21% (11%) more likely to be in an accident in the following six months than drivers that get their first ticket just before a scandal (any other day). This main result is robust to the specific definition of a police scandal and the selected sample, but depends on the period of study. I use national media to evaluate if the effect is bigger for scandals in which the police is clearly at fault, with some evidence in this direction. I explore ticket payment, subsequent tickets and accidents to validate the behavioral hypothesis that sanctions by illegitimate authorities have a lower effect on changing behavior. My results suggest that increasing the legitimacy of existing sanctions is more urgent than increasing the number of ticketed drivers.


* **The role of legitimacy on deterrence: a speed-control intervention** *([pdf](/assets/Cameras.pdf))*

	**Abstract**:
	The deterrence effect of legal sanctions has been widely studied and measured. Less attention has been given to the mechanisms by which some sanctions are more deterrent than others. This paper suggests one possible mechanism: the legitimacy of legal sanctions. I present a model in which individuals respond to a legal sanction for previously non-regulated behavior. An implication of the model is that more legitimate sanctions, those with higher social acceptance of the mandated behavior, cause a larger change in the targeted behavior. I test this hypothesis on the Cámaras Salvavidas Program, a speed-control intervention in Bogotá, Colombia. I estimate a Non-linear Difference in Difference equation, using the staggered implementation of the program as source of exogeneity. Legitimacy of legal sanctions is the source of heterogeneity. The program has a bigger effect in locations where the speed limit is more legitimate. It is shown that the result is robust to different ways of measuring legitimacy. Policy implications are discussed, suggesting that less strict but more legitimate sanctions might have a larger impact in reducing socially unwanted behavior.
