I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at the Universidad de los Andes (Bogotá, Colombia) under the guidance of [José Guerra](https://jguerraforero.wixsite.com/joseaguerra) and [Ignacio Sarmiento-Barbieri](https://ignaciomsarmiento.github.io/).

My work centers on applied microeconomics. In particular, I study the effect of social norms on risky behaviors.

The first chapter of my thesis studies the effect of norm legitimacy on the deterrence of legal sanctions. I study this in the context of traffic infractions using the Speed Camera program implmeented in Bogotá on 2020 as a case study. 
The second chapter studies the effect of institutional legitimacy on the efficacy of legal sanctions. I measure the effect of police scandals on the deterrent capacity of traffic tickets, using Google Trends data and traffic tickets and accidents in Bogotá.
My third chapter will be an experiment on the effect that fiction reading has on social norms that foster prosociality.

I also have a career in fiction writing. My novel _Economía Experimental_ won the 2022 National Prize by the Ministry of Culture. It came about in September 2023 in a beautiful edition by [angosta editores](https://www.angosta.co/producto/economia-experimental/)
