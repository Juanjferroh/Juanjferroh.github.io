* **Can’t Stop the One-Armed Bandits: The Effects of Access to Gambling on Crime** *()*
	*(with [Nicolas Bottan](https://www.nicolasbottan.com/) and [Andrés Ham](https://andresham.com/))*
	
	**Abstract**:
	We estimate the effects on criminal activity due to the approval of state legislation in Illinois that legalized video gambling. The bill gave municipalities discretion over whether to allow video gambling within their local boundaries. Many jurisdictions adjacent to Chicago opted in, while the City of Chicago opted out. These decisions create a natural experiment that allows studying the effects of increasing access to gambling on crime. Using detailed incident-level crime data and a difference-in-differences strategy, we find that (i) access to gambling increases violent and property crimes; (ii) these crimes represent "new" rather than displaced incidents; and (iii) effects are persistent over time. We further study downstream effects on property values, finding that properties adjacent to gambling establishments sell on average at a three percent discount.


* **Racial Discrimination in the United States Rental Market** [[NBER WP No. 29516]](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29516)
*(with [Peter Christensen](https://www.uiuc-bdeep.org/christensen) and [Christopher Timmins](https://sites.duke.edu/christophertimmins/))*

	**Abstract**:
	We report evidence on discriminatory behavior from the largest correspondence study conducted to date in the rental housing market. Using more than 25,000 interactions with rental property managers across the 50 largest U.S. cities, the study reveals that African American and Hispanic/LatinX renters continue to face discriminatory constraints in the majority of U.S. cities although there are important regional differences. Stronger discriminatory constraints on renters of color (particularly African Americans) are also associated with higher levels of residential segregation and larger gaps in intergenerational income mobility. Using matched evidence on the actual rental outcomes at the properties in our experiment, we show that correspondence study measurements of discrimination do indeed predict actual outcomes.
